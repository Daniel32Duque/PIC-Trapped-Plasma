These are the core source files for the plasma simulations.
They are divided by functionality:

1) Plasma.hpp and Plasma.cpp contain the functionality of the plasma class
2) PenningTrap.hpp and PenningTrap.cpp contain the functionality of the trap

To run the code you need to build your own main file, depending on what it is you want to simulate. This usually is less than 10-20 lines.
Look at the .hpp files to see what are the public methods of each class, there are very few, mostly printing stuff.
